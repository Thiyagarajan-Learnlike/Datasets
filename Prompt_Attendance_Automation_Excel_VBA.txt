Create a VBA macro in Excel for an attendance sheet that has columns for S.No, Roll No, Name, and multiple date columns in dd-mm-yyyy format. The macro should first ask me to select a date from the header row, then mark all students as “P” (Present) by default for that date. After that, I should be able to enter all absent students’ S.No values in a single InputBox separated by commas (for example: 2,5,10), and the macro should update those students as “A” (Absent) for that chosen date. The solution should handle up to 50 students with S.No starting from 1, ignore blank input if no absentees are provided, and skip any invalid S.No entries beyond the available range. Finally, it should display a confirmation message such as “Attendance updated for <date>”.
